### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 35 years old, I am married and a father. I have been working with technology for 14 years and with web development for 11 years. In recent years I've been working mainly with Laravel (PHP) and Angular 2+. I gained extensive experience in these frameworks through working as a developer and team mentor at Followize. At the moment I'm much more focused on the front-end, although I still have contact with the back-end. I love web development and technology and I'm always looking for new knowledge and technologies to make my work better and better.

Need some help or wants to know more about me? Please check my LinkedIn Profile(https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaocamposy/?locale=en_US).
